Sublime settings for SublimeText (a sublime words game)

Here is a really cool settings file for SublimeText. It assumes that you have installed:

1. The awesome Adobe's **Source Code Pro** typeface.
	
   You may grab it here at Adobe GitHub repo: [https://github.com/adobe/source-code-pro](https://github.com/adobe/source-code-pro)

2. The awesome **Solarized Dark Theme**.

	You can have it here from my buddy Michael's repo: [https://github.com/mybuddymichael/solarized-sublimetext2](https://github.com/mybuddymichael/solarized-sublimetext2)

To use these settings or any of them just copy and paste in your SublimeText settings (**CTRL** + **,** on Windows and Linux, or **CMD** + **,** in Mac).

Enjoy!
